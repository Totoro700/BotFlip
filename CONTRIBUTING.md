## Who can contribute?


Anybody, including you.


## Do I have to know a lot C++ or other languages to contribute?


Nope, you don't have to help by programming it! By testing it(running it) and [reporting issues](https://github.com/Totoro700/BotFlip/issues/new) you are already helping!

## Rules for _typing_ code


Please label your code by commenting (C++: double slashes) because other people may not know what you created the function for

You can use Java-like braces if you want

When naming variables, try not to put dashes and underscores. Instead, use Camel case (ex.: camelCaseVariable)

When naming classes, use Pascal case (ex.: PascalCaseClass)

When naming function, it is up to you! (I prefer Camel case though)

Please do _not_ make your code look messy

Example:

int foo(int numOne,int numTwo){return num+numTwo;}

Try not to use multi-line comments. (You can use them if you want though)
