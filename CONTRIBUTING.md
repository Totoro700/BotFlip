Basic rules for contributing in [this repository](https://github.com/Totoro700/BotFlip)

## Who can contribute?


Anybody, including you.


## Do I have to know a lot C++ or other languages to contribute?


Nope, you don't have to help by programming it! By testing it(running it) and [reporting issues](https://github.com/Totoro700/BotFlip/issues/new) you are already helping!

## Rules for _typing_ code


Please label your code by commenting (C++: double slashes) because other people may not know what you created the function for

Good:
```cpp
// Function for adding two numbers
int add(int numOne, int numTwo)
{
    return numOne + numTwo;
}
```

Bad:
```cpp
int add(int a, int b)
{
    return a+b;
}
```

You can use Java-like braces if you want

When naming variables, try not to put underscores. Instead, use Camel case (ex.: camelCaseVariable)

Good:
```cpp
int numOne = 0;
string userInput = NULL;
```

Bad:
```cpp
int Num_One = 0;
string User_Input = NULL;
```

When naming classes, try not to use underscores. Instead, use Pascal case (ex.: PascalCaseClass)

Good:
```cpp
// Example class
class ExampleClass
{
public:
    int foo = 24;
}
```

Bad:
```cpp
class Exmapleclass
{
public:
    int foo=24;
}
```

When naming functions, it is up to you! (I prefer Camel case though)

Please do _not_ make your code look messy

Good:

```cpp
// Function for adding two numbers

int foo(int numOne, int numTwo)

{

  return numOne + numTwo;
  
}
```


Bad:

```cpp
int foo(int numOne,int numTwo){return num+numTwo;}
```
