# Bots

---

I this repository I create bots you can use commands on(kind of like Windows cmd). 

So far there are only a [python bot](https://github.com/Totoro700/bots/blob/main/PyBot.py) (.py) and a [c++ bot](https://github.com/Totoro700/bots/blob/main/CppBot.cpp) (.cpp)

I also created a [website](Totoro700.github.io/bots) where you can download them.
