# How to install

---

```cpp
void install()
{
  install("BotFlip.exe");
}
```

Windows only, sorry Mac users, I don't have executable file for Mac, you can run the [C++ script](https://github.com/Totoro700/BotFlip/blob/main/BotFlip.cpp)

## Windows

1. Go to the green buttong that says code with a download icon

2. Click it

3. Click Download Zip

4. Wait for it to download

5. Once downloaded, open it (just the .zip)

6. Click extract all and extract  to your Documents folder

7. Once finished, open the folder, and click "Debug"

8. Double click "BotFlip.exe"

9. THere might be some errors, or something, but it is your choice, if you don't want to run it, click "Don't run", if you do want to run it(the .exe), click "More info" and "Run anyway"

10. That should be it!

11. If there is any other errors, make sure you include __all__ or the files inside the __same__ folder
